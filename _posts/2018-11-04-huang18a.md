title: Cartoon-to-Photo Facial Translation with Generative Adversarial Networks
abstract: "Cartoon-to-photo facial translation could be widely used in different applications,
  such as law enforcement and anime remaking. Nevertheless, current general-purpose
  image-to-image models usually produce blurry or unrelated results
  in this task. In this paper, we propose a Cartoon-to-Photo facial translation with
  Generative Adversarial Networks CP-GAN for inverting cartoon faces to generate
  photo-realistic and related face images. In order to produce convincing faces with
  intact facial parts, we exploit global and local discriminators to capture global
  facial features and three local facial regions, respectively. Moreover, we use a
  specific content network to capture and preserve face characteristic and identity
  between cartoons and photos. As a result, the proposed approach can generate convincing
  high-quality faces that satisfy both the characteristic and identity constraints
  of input cartoon faces. Compared with recent works on unpaired image-to-image translation,
  our proposed method is able to generate more realistic and correlative images."
